So Long is the first graphic project of the 42 cursus. A very simple library (the libmlx) is used to create a small 2D video game where a player must escape the map after collecting some collectibles by going to the exit with the least number of moves.

A libmlx tutorial can be found at : https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html

More informattion can be found in the PDF.
